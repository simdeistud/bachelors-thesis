\chapter{Summary}\label{chap:summ}

In this thesis I will be reporting my work done developing upon a Java-based LEGv8 ISA simulator.
\\

In the Introduction I will provide a brief overview of the LEGv8 ISA together with the reasons for choosing this thesis project in the context of the Digital Architectures course.
\\

In Chapter 1 I will provide a short summary of the current landscape of software simulators available online for the LEGv8 ISA. I will end the chapter with a focus on the simulator chosen for this thesis' project, namely the LEGv8 simulator developed and distributed by Arm Holdings plc. I will give an overview of its working state, functionality and structure prior to my development efforts.
\\

In Chapter 2 I will present the work done to decouple the project from the Eclipse IDE and migrate it to a modern build automation system, namely Maven.
\\

In the Chapter 3 I will showcase the bugs that have been fixed and I will introduce all of the functionalities that have been added to the simulator and the structural changes by them entailed.
\\

In Chapter 4 I will talk about the shortcomings of the simulator and the work that can be done to further improve it.
