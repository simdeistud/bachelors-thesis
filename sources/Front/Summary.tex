\chapter{Summary}

In this thesis I will be reporting my work done developing upon a web-based LEGv8 ISA simulator.
\\

In the Introduction I will provide an overview of the LEGv8 ISA together with the reasons for choosing this thesis project in the context of the Digital Architectures course.
\\

In Chapter 1 I will provide a brief summary of the current landscape of software simulators available online for the LEGv8 ISA, together with their advantages and shortcomings. I will end the chapter with a focus on the simulator chosen for this thesis' project, namely the LEGv8 simulator developed and distributed by Arm Holdings plc. I will give an overview of its working state, functionality and structure prior to my development efforts.
\\

In Chapter 2 I will showcase the bugs that have been fixed and I will introduce all of the functionalities that have been added to the simulator and the structural changes by them entailed, paying particular attention to the ones that have proven to be more challenging to implement or reverse-engineer.
\\

In the Chapter 3 I will present the work done to decouple the project from the Eclipse IDE and migrate it to a modern build automation system, namely Maven.
\\

In Chapter 4 I will talk about the shortcomings of the simulator and the work that can be done to further improve it.
