This thesis' work has consisted in analizing ARM Education's official LEGv8 simulator, bringing it up to an acceptable working state and extending it by implementing the entirety of the LEGv8 ISA and improving its general functioning and UI. As of this date, this is the only publicly available simulator to offer a complete implementation of LEGv8 and a comprehensive visualization of the stack, all of the registers, and the step-by-step state of execution.
