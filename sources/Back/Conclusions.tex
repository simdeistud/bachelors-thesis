In conclusion, this thesis' work has been taking ARM Education's officialy LEGv8 simulator, bringing it up to an acceptably working state and extending it by implementing the entirety of the LEGv8 ISA. As of this date, this is the only publicly available simulator to offer a complete implementation of LEGv8 and offering a comprehensive visualization of the stack, all of the registers, and the step-by-step state of execution.
